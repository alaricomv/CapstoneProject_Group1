# WholesaleConnect

Welcome to WholesaleConnect, a platform designed for wholesale businesses to manage their operations efficiently. This repository contains both the backend and frontend components of the WholesaleConnect application.

## Getting Started

Before you can run WholesaleConnect, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Backend Setup

1. **Import the Database:**
   - Locate the SQL file for the database: `backend/database/wholesaledb.sql`.
   - Import this SQL file into your preferred database management system.

2. **Run the Backend:**
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the backend directory:
     ```
     cd backend/
     ```
   - Start the backend server by running:
     ```
     node app.js
     ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Angular CLI (First Time Only):**
   - If you haven't installed Angular CLI globally before, do it by running:
     ```
     npm install -g @angular/cli
     ```
   - This step is required only the first time or if you haven't installed Angular CLI previously.

2. **Run the Frontend:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```
     cd frontend/wholesaleconnect/
     ```
   - Start the frontend server:
     ```
     ng serve --open
     ```
   - The `--open` flag automatically opens the application in your default web browser.
